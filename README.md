# Mia yun Ruse's `.config`

Hey hi howdy! These are my personal configuration files for the terminal.

**Please steal anything you find useful.** It's public for a reason!

I think [XDG Base Directory spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) is really dang neat, so this repository is my `~/.config` directory. Anything which doesn't support this is symlinked in.

## Miscellaneous todo

- [ ] Use a symlink manager (gnu stow)
- [ ] Random planets in `.zlogin`!
- [ ] Autodetect styling in `hcat`
