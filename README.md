# Mia yun Ruse's `.config`

Hey hi howdy! These are my personal configuration files and bash scripts for the terminal.

It's mostly just so I can track changes and keep `.config` clean (would recommend) but **if anything looks useful please use it!** It's totally public domain, yo.

## Miscellaneous todo

- [ ] Get `countdown` to use macOS countdown
- [ ] Use a symlink manager (gnu stow)
- [ ] Random planets in `.zlogin`!
- [ ] Autodetect styling in `hcat`

## Thoughts

I tend to use macOS, [`zsh`](https://zsh.sourceforge.io), [`micro`](https://micro-editor.github.io) and VS code, because they all have the principle of "good for power users, amazing defaults." I think terminals and GUIs are both neat and elitism either way is Silly.

I think [XDG Base Directory spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) is really dang neat, so this repository is my `~/.config` directory. Anything which doesn't support this is symlinked in.
